# Algo Trading Prototype

This project contains a minimal trading dashboard built with FastAPI. Version 3
(`delta_v3`) is the recommended folder to run. Older versions are kept for
reference.

## Running

```bash
cd delta_v3
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

A local Redis instance must be running on `localhost:6379`.
Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
